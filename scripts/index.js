    <p>Wingman is Gekko's primary ability that launches a ground-based creature forward to scan for enemies in a wide cone. If an enemy is detected, Wingman charges toward them and, if close enough, jumps and releases a concussive blast. Wingman can also bounce off walls while scanning, and if the enemy escapes his range, he resumes moving in a straight line.</p>
    <p>Besides combat, Wingman can plant or defuse the spike using Alt Fire. On attack, Gekko can send him to plant the spike at a targeted location; on defense, Wingman can defuse it. He takes the shortest possible path, even jumping over obstacles. Wingman can be destroyed by enemy fire, turning into a globule that Gekko can reclaim to reset the cooldown. If not reclaimed in time, he disappears.</p>
  `;

    <p>Dizzy is Gekko's Blind ability that launches a projectile which charges briefly before activating. Once active, Dizzy slows down and fires plasma blasts at any enemies in her line of sight within range, potentially hitting multiple targets. The blasts create a splash zone that blinds affected enemies by covering their screen and minimap with plasma, leaving only minimal edge visibility that fades over time.</p>
    <p>Dizzy cannot be avoided by looking away and will expire after a set duration or if destroyed by enemy fire. When she expires, she transforms into a dormant Globule that Gekko can later retrieve.</p>

    <P>Mosh Pit is Gekko's Deterrent ability that must be equipped before use. When cast, Gekko throws Mosh as a projectile, or underhand with Alt Fire for a shorter range. Upon hitting a horizontal surface, Mosh duplicates and creates a large circular zone that rapidly expands from the point of impact.</p>
    <p>Any enemy caught in the area begins taking continuous damage immediately. After a short delay, the zone detonates, dealing multiple bursts of damage. Enemies within the large inner radius receive full damage, while those in the smaller outer radius take reduced damage.</p>
  `;
  const thrashParagraph = `
    <p>Thrash is Gekko's Intel ability that he must equip before use. When cast, Gekko takes control of Thrash, steering her along the ground while his body remains stationary and vulnerable. Thrash auto-moves forward, with limited vision and controls for direction and jumping. She can be commanded to lunge forward and explode, detaining any agents in the blast radius including Gekko and his allies  while shifting Gekkos view to third-person during the lunge.</p>
    <p>After the explosion or when her duration ends, Gekko regains control of his body, with his vision radius briefly limited before fully restoring. Thrash expires after her first use each round, whether by detonation, duration, enemy damage, or manual cancel. When she expires, she becomes a dormant Globule that Gekko can reclaim.</p>
